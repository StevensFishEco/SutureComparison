### Load Packages ###

Lets start by loading the packages that we will use to analyze and visualize our data. Note that I have all messages "turned off" for this code chunk. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

require(ggplot2)


```

### Load Data ###

Next, we will load our surgical data.

```{r}

datafull <- read.csv("Suture_Surgery_Data.csv")


```

### Data Visualization ###

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
